# Palindrome Syndrome

### Introduction
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards and forwards.

### Problem Statement
Write out a method named `palindrome?` that takes in a string as an argument and determines whether that string is a palindrome.  Do **not** use `.reverse`

### Example

* `palindrome?("racecar")` gives a boolean output of **true** because "racecar" is a palindrome.
* `palindrome?("flatiron")` gives a boolean output of **false** because "flatiron" is not a palindrome.

What would the output for the following strings be?
* `palindrome?("noon")`
* `palindrome?("five")`
* `palindrome?("radar")`
* `palindrome?("learnlovecode")`

### Bonus
Try rewriting the `palindrome?` method to use (recursion)[https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion&oq=recursion&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1251j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]
